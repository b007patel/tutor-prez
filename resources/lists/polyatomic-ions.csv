# grouped by +ve charge/-ve charge, then sorted by
# - non-O/H element, alphabetically
# - form of this element's polyatomic ions, from complex to simple
# - duplicates by chemical formula will be commented out, with the lowest
#   charge form remaining uncommented
# This ordering is key to avoid misidentifying more complex ions as a
# mixture of simpler ions and/or elements (e.g., to avoid interpreting
# HCO3[-] as two separate components H and CO3[2-])
#
# If exporting from Libre Calc try replacing '^"#' with '#"' to fix
# commented out ions
