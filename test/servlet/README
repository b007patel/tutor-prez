- a .war file has the following structure:

/WEB-INF/classes/...
/WEN-INF/libs/...
/WEB-INF/web.xml

- need 3rd party JARs in libs. Can either go with exploded user classes in
  classes, or a user JAR in libs
- web.xml is in this directory
- the current process to make a war is
--- ./build-jdk7.sh
--- ./make_war.sh
--- copy resulting war to Ubuntu box
